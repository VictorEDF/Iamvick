        <h3>Hello World</h3>
        <p>An aspiring web developer,<br/>
        and this is my first webpage.</p>

         <h5 id="Section-header">ABOUT ME</h5>
         <p>I am just a simple guy looking to test his skills in technical abilities and yeah, that is just the summary of how I ended up in the world of <strong>TECH</strong></p>
         <p>Educational qualification as of yet, are still <strong>:</strong></p>
         <ul>
          <li>FSLC</li>
          <li>SSCE</li>
         </ul> 
        <p>Yeah, I know, that's kinda loose right?<br/>
        but it is what it is you know, all college plans are on hold until the <strong>FULL-STACK GOAL</strong> is achieved.</p>
        <p>Without further ado that would be all about my <i>BIOGRAPHY</i>.</p>

    <section id="Skills">
        <h5 id="Section-header">SKILLS</h5>
        <p>So far I've been able to get my hands on the <i>2</i> core programming technologies, <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> and this webpage build right now is just to showcase my strength in these technologies. </p>
        <p>I've also had encounters with real time programmming lanmguages like <strong>Javascript</strong> of which I will be implementing in my Future projects very soonest.</p>
        <p>Further knowledge of Libraries like <strong>REACT</strong> has also been acquired, and will be showcased by building some projects very soon as well. </p>
        <p>So stay tuned as I explore the world of programming and like earlier said <i>Make an impact on the world</i>.</p>
